Sure, let's break down the workflow for the pension and claims process:

1. **Listing of Employees Eligible for Retirement**:
   - Initially, there's a system or module where administrators
    or HR personnel can view a list of employees who are eligible for retirement within the next 9 months.
     This list is filtered by the selected Ministry, Department, or Agency (MDA).

2. **Selection of Employees**:
   - After viewing the list of eligible employees, administrators can select specific employees from the list.
    These selected employees will proceed to the next step.

3. **Notification for Registration**:
   - Once selected, the system sends notifications to the chosen employees, informing them to register on a separate portal. 
   This portal is specifically designed for uploading necessary retirement documents. Notifications are typically sent via emails provided by the employees.

4. **Registration and Document Upload**:
   - Employees who receive notifications register on the portal and upload the required retirement documents. 
   These documents may include pension forms, identification documents, financial information, and any other necessary paperwork.

5. **Notification Tracking**:
   - Administrators have access to a page where they can track the status of notifications sent. 
   This page lists employees who have been notified to register and upload documents but have not yet completed the process.

6. **Document Submission Tracking**:
   - Another page is available for administrators to track employees who have successfully submitted their retirement documents. 
   This page provides an overview of employees who have completed the registration and document upload process.

7. **Document Review and Approval**:
   - After documents are submitted, administrators can review the uploaded documents to ensure they meet the necessary requirements. 
   There might be a detailed view for each employee where administrators can inspect each document closely.
   - Once reviewed, administrators have the option to approve the retirement application for each employee.

Overall, this workflow ensures a streamlined process for managing pension and claims applications, from initial eligibility assessment to document submission and approval.
 It helps administrators efficiently handle retirement requests and ensures that employees receive timely notifications and support throughout the process.
